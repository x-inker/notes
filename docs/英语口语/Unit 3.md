B:Typically，true love refers to pure and sincere emotion.
A:Maybe just a little.But now， what the most important is how to find true love. I want to know your understanding about true love.
B: Love has many meanings,I think love is different for different people.
A: Go,on.
B: Ok. I consider that true love means not only a pleasure, but also loyalty and obligation. To love is to give and sacrifice. One who can not create happiness, even make sacrifice for his beloved,  can not be counted as a true lover.
A∶I agree with you. True lovers are willing to sacrifice themselves for each other's sake,  and true love needs no expression.
